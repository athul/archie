You are managing multiple projects, getting lots of email and messages on different messaging systems, managing finances and personal health habits and so much more.
It all keeps piling up, and it can feel overwhelming.
How do you keep up with it all? How do you find focus and peace and get stuff accomplished when you have too much on your plate?</description></item><item><title>Getting Started with Traveling Ultralight</title><link>https://athul.github.io/archie/posts/post-4/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Mar 2020 12:13:35 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://athul.github.io/archie/posts/post-4/</guid><description>I’m on a trip at the moment, and a friend who generously let me sleep on his couch looked at my small travel backpack and commented on how little I travel with: “That’s impressive,” he said.
I was a little surprised, because though I’ve gotten that comment before, it’s become normal for me to travel with just a small bag (10 lbs. or less, usually), and I have friends who travel with even less.</description></item><item><title>How to test dark mode?</title><link>https://athul.github.io/archie/posts/post-7/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Mar 2018 12:13:38 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://athul.github.io/archie/posts/post-7/</guid><description>Here is how you can setup dark mode for Ink and test on various OS like iOS, Android, macOS and Windows 10.</description></item><item><title>Typography</title><link>https://athul.github.io/archie/posts/post-5/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Mar 2018 12:13:38 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://athul.github.io/archie/posts/post-5/</guid><description>Lid est laborum et dolorum fuga.

I’ve been a lifelong procrastinator, at least until recent years. I would put things off until deadline, because I knew I could come through. I came through on tests after cramming last minute, I turned articles in at the deadline after waiting until the last hour, I got things done.
Until I didn’t. It turns out procrastinating caused me to miss deadlines, over and over.</description></item><item><title>Fearlessness: How to Stop Running from Space</title><link>https://athul.github.io/archie/posts/post-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Mar 2018 12:13:30 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://athul.github.io/archie/posts/post-2/</guid><description>We spend our days filling in every available space, cramming in more tasks, responding to messages, checking social media and online sites, watching videos.
We are afraid of empty space in our lives.
The result is often a continual busyness, constant distraction and avoidance, lack of focus, lack of satisfaction with our lives.
We run from silence. We run from the spaces between tasks and appointments. We run from solitude and stillness.</description></item></channel></rss>
