<p>What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you stupid butcher? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in medical school, and I’ve been involved in numerous bar brawls and student protests in the capital, and I own over 300 microscopes. I am trained in the injection of antibiotics, and I’m the top practitioner in the entire Thanatica lab. You are nothing to me but just another test subject. You better run before I take out my scalpel, or you'll need a degree to understand what's happening to you, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit by sending me a letter at 10pm? Think again, cowfucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of drunks across the town and your hideout is being staked out right now so you better prepare for the storm, worm. The storm that makes the Sand Pest look like a light fever. You’re fucking dead, "oynon". I can get anywhere, slowly, and do whatever I want around here, since I'm the only one with a degree in this shithole of a town. I let the Plague infect over 700 people yesterday, just to study it, and the town rulers still gave me full authority and emergency powers. Not only am I extensively trained in the use of revolvers, but I have access to the entire arsenal of Griff's warehouses and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable backwater traditions off the face of the earth, you little primitive. If only you could have followed the lines to deduce what your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have stayed in the fucking abbatoir where you belong. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, and it's three times higher than yesterday. Medicum morbo adhibere. You’re fucking dead, emshen.</p>
